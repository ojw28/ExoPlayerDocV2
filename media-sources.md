title: Media sources
---

In ExoPlayer every piece of media is represented by `MediaSource`. The ExoPlayer
library provides `MediaSource` implementations for several stream types:

* `ProgressiveMediaSource` for regular media files.
* `DashMediaSource` for [DASH][].
* `SsMediaSource` for [SmoothStreaming][].
* `HlsMediaSource` for [HLS][].

Examples of instantiating all four can be found in `PlayerActivity` in the [main
demo app][].

## MediaSource composition ##

In addition to the MediaSource implementations described above, the ExoPlayer
library also provides `ConcatenatingMediaSource`, `ClippingMediaSource`,
`LoopingMediaSource` and `MergingMediaSource`. These `MediaSource`
implementations enable more complex playback functionality through composition.
Some of the common use cases are described below. Note that although some of the
following examples are described in the context of video playback, they apply
equally to audio only playback too, and indeed to the playback of any supported
media type(s).

### Playing a playlist ###

Playlists are supported using `ConcatenatingMediaSource`, which enables
sequential playback of multiple `MediaSource`s. It's possible to dynamically
modify a playlist by adding, removing and moving `MediaSource`s within a
`ConcatenatingMediaSource` during playback. See the [Playlists page][] for more
information.

### Clipping a video ###

`ClippingMediaSource` can be used to clip a `MediaSource` so that only part of
it is played. The following example clips a video playback to start at 5 seconds
and end at 10 seconds.

~~~
MediaSource videoSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(videoUri);
// Clip to start at 5 seconds and end at 10 seconds.
ClippingMediaSource clippingSource =
    new ClippingMediaSource(
        videoSource,
        /* startPositionUs= */ 5_000_000,
        /* endPositionUs= */ 10_000_000);
~~~
{: .language-java}

To clip only the start of the source, `endPositionUs` can be set to
`C.TIME_END_OF_SOURCE`. To clip only to a particular duration, there is a
constructor that takes a `durationUs` argument.

When clipping the start of a video file, try to align the start position with a
keyframe if possible. If the start position is not aligned with a keyframe then
the player will need to decode and discard data from the previous keyframe up to
the start position before playback can begin. This will introduce a short delay
at the start of playback, including when the player transitions to playing the
`ClippingMediaSource` as part of a playlist or due to looping.

### Looping a video ###

To loop indefinitely, it is better to use `ExoPlayer.setRepeatMode` than
`LoopingMediaSource`.
{:.info}

A video can be seamlessly looped a fixed number of times using a
`LoopingMediaSource`. The following example plays a video twice.

~~~
MediaSource source =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(videoUri);
// Plays the video twice.
LoopingMediaSource loopingSource = new LoopingMediaSource(source, 2);
~~~
{: .language-java}

### Side-loading a subtitle file ###

Given a video file and a separate subtitle file, `MergingMediaSource` can be
used to merge them into a single source for playback.

~~~
// Build the video MediaSource.
MediaSource videoSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(videoUri);
// Build the subtitle MediaSource.
Format subtitleFormat = Format.createTextSampleFormat(
    id, // An identifier for the track. May be null.
    MimeTypes.APPLICATION_SUBRIP, // The mime type. Must be set correctly.
    selectionFlags, // Selection flags for the track.
    language); // The subtitle language. May be null.
MediaSource subtitleSource =
    new SingleSampleMediaSource.Factory(...)
        .createMediaSource(subtitleUri, subtitleFormat, C.TIME_UNSET);
// Plays the video with the sideloaded subtitle.
MergingMediaSource mergedSource =
    new MergingMediaSource(videoSource, subtitleSource);
~~~
{: .language-java}

## Advanced composition ##

Itâ€™s possible to further combine composite `MediaSource`s for more unusual use
cases. Given two videos A and B, the following example shows how
`LoopingMediaSource` and `ConcatenatingMediaSource` can be used together to play
the sequence (A,A,B).

~~~
MediaSource firstSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(firstVideoUri);
MediaSource secondSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(secondVideoUri);
// Plays the first video twice.
LoopingMediaSource firstSourceTwice = new LoopingMediaSource(firstSource, 2);
// Plays the first video twice, then the second video.
ConcatenatingMediaSource concatenatedSource =
    new ConcatenatingMediaSource(firstSourceTwice, secondSource);
~~~
{: .language-java}

The following example is equivalent, demonstrating that there can be more than
one way of achieving the same result.

~~~
MediaSource firstSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(firstVideoUri);
MediaSource secondSource =
    new ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(...).createMediaSource(secondVideoUri);
// Plays the first video twice, then the second video.
ConcatenatingMediaSource concatenatedSource =
    new ConcatenatingMediaSource(firstSource, firstSource, secondSource);
